# Subordination

Question: to what extent does the model maintain a representation of an unmet syntactic requirement?  What interferes with it?

Design: 2x2x4x4:
* presence/absence of initial subordinator;
* return to main clause, or not. 
* intervening subordinate PP/SRC/ORC on subject of subordinate clause;
* intervening subordinate PP/SRC/ORC on object of subordinate clause;

e.g.,

As the doctor studied the textbook .

As the doctor studied the textbook , the nurse walked into the office .

The doctor studied the textbook .

The doctor studied the textbook , the nurse walked into the office .

and "the doctor" can be modified by (all same # words):
* in a long white lab coat
* who was wearing a white lab coat
* who the administrator had recently hired

and "the textbook" can be modified by (all same # words):
* about several recent advances in cancer therapy
* that described several advances in cancer therapy
* that colleagues had written on cancer therapy

The evidence for maintained syntactic dependency is the 2x2 interaction of the presence/absence of the initial subordinator with +/- main-clause continuation on surprisal of the (main-clause+final/just final) content.  We can then see how each of the additional intervening phrases of various types pushes around this surprisal-size interaction.
