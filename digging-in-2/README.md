# digging-in round 2

Same design as before but now we add material so that the distance between the main verb and the subordinator is controlled across length conditions.

Still looking for a 2x3 interaction of NP/Z ambiguity and three levels of length of material between the onset of the ambiguity and its resolution.

We expect a positive interaction of ambiguity presence and length of material (short vs. long and also short vs. verylong).

Additionally we expect an interaction with length as encoded numerically (0, 1, 2 for the three conditions short, long, and verylong).

Items are based on Tabor & Hutchins (2004) but with the addition of the verylong condition, where the interaction will be zero for any 5-gram model.
