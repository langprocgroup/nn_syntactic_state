# garden-pathing

## reduction and morphological verb form

This is pretty classic: it's a 2x2 interaction of relative-clause verb ambiguity and RC reduction:

The woman (who was) brought/given a sandwich from the kitchen tripped.

We predict an interaction between reduction & verb ambiguity on the disambiguator.  Whether it shows up beyond that would be evidence of parallel state maintenance (if parallel state is maintained well and the disambiguator's syntactic signal is used effectively, there should be good garden-path recovery and we should not see the same interaction on the following content).
